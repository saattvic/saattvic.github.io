### Consulting

I am Founder and Expert at [Sapient Econ](https://www.sapient-econ.com/).  I have previously worked at several economic consultancies and law firms.  I specialize in supporting antitrust litigation.  A brief consulting bio is available [here](/files/Bio%20-%20Saattvic.pdf).  I will be joining [Econic Partners](https://econicpartners.com/)' Washington DC office in June 2025.

### LGBTQ+ Activism

I was among several petitioners before the Indian Supreme Court fighting for marriage equality in India ([link](https://www.trust.org/i/?id=a25aae9d-565b-4932-a21e-b23f856a17ac), [link](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/india-lgbtq-same-sex-marriage-1.6773551), [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk5rfe2p62g), [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4lGH2ZAl30), [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jupQbmjFjP0)).  The Indian Supreme Court [did not rule in our favor](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/10/india-failure-to-legalise-same-sex-marriage-a-setback-for-human-rights/), unfortunately.  I have also written columns for several media outlets ([link](http://bornofweb.com/i-am-gay-im-an-actor-ive-got-a-message-for-you-all/), [link](https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/brunch/guest-column-gay-pride-and-prejudice-101619316186600.html), [link](https://spartacus.gayguide.travel/blog/insider-gay-bollywood-actor-saattvic/)), have been covered by others ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGUTkQr7TD4)), and have appeared on sevearal news programs and podcasts to discuss LGBTQ+ issues ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWdh41r4glA)).

### The Performing Arts

I have been in a Bollywood movie and a TV show (yes, I have an [IMDB page](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm11890501/)).  I have written, directed, produced and acted in several stage plays ([link](https://nooranandchawla.com/qissebaazi-a-multilingual-storytelling-wah-wah-wah/), [link](https://gaysifamily.com/culture/interview-actor-director-of-the-pad-saattvic/), [link](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/theatre-review-ten-years-with-guru-dutt-abrar-alvis-journey/articleshow/17507422.cms)), TV commercials, and short films ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pve6x6nKBpA)).  I play the tabla, an Indian classical percussion instrument ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMT5wVvAFJo), [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0jmxij-CSg)).  I collaborate with Indian classical and contemporary dancers as a dramaturg.
